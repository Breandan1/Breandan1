- 👋 Hi, I’m @Breandan1 , I'm a student ,& love to study the flow of the crypto market . I'm a small time investor in a couple different crypto currencies and would be further along if I had more capital . I don't have much family to depend on so don't have a lot of liquid capitol outside of school expenses and living expenses to really make my mark 
- 👀 I’m interested in any advice or help getting to the next level in life of indecent finances and stress free living 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to write code and possibly collaborate on starting OUR OWN crypto currencies that the world will one day need & use for a variety of different options 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any and all ideas to make some serious capital and asset's. Would really like to collaborate on starting a crypto currency or even Real Art NFT's
